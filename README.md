# Golang Mini Project

This is my first Golang mini project after studying for 2 days.

## Introduction

In this project, I've tried my hand at Golang for the first time, and I'm excited to share what I've learned. If you have any recommendations, suggestions, or feedback, please feel free to reach out.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <https://github.com/300degree/golang-crud-example.git>`
2. Install Golang on your machine if you haven't already. You can download it from [here](https://golang.org/dl/).
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd ~/golang-crud-example`
4. Run the project using the Golang compiler: `go run main.go`

**Don't forget to set up your .env file before running the project.**
